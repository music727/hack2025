# **Automated Invoice and Payment Reconciliation for D365 Finance**

**Problem statement**:
Invoice/Payment reconciliation process is a critical financial control process where finance team compare company's internal records against statements or reports provided by vendors or customers to ensure all transactions are properly recorded and matched. It involves checking if issued/received invoices have been paid, and confirm any outstanding balances while resolving discrepancies. 

**Current challenges**
- This is a periodic task which is currently not supported in Dynamikcs 365 Finance
- Manual process taking 2-5 days per reconciliation cycle on averag
- High error rates due to human oversight
- Delayed identification of payment issues leading to vendor relationship strain
- Resource-intensive process requiring dedicated FTE allocation
- Limited real-time visibility into reconciliation status as the process takes such time

**Business value (based on research)**:
- Time savings: Reduce reconciliation time from 2-5 days to 2-4 hours
**ROI: 80-90% time reduction = $156,000 annual savings (assuming $65K FTE cost)**
- Error reduction: Decrease discrepancy rate from an average 3-5% to <0.5%
**ROI: Reduce write-offs and penalty fees by estimated $75,000 annually**
- Cash Flow Optimization: Faster identification of payment issues
**ROI: Improve cash flow by $500K+ through faster dispute resolution**
- Compliance Enhancement: Automated audit trails and documentation
**ROI: Reduce audit costs by 30-40% ($25,000 annual savings)**
- Vendor Relationship Improvement: Faster dispute resolution and payment processing
**ROI: Avoid early payment discount losses (~$50,000 annually)**
**Total Estimated Annual Value: $806,000+**

**Proces flow**:

*Accounts Payable (Vendor) Invoice/Payment Reconciliation Process*
1. Statement Preparation
- Receive vendor statements (weekly/monthly)
- Gather internal records: AP aging, payment records, invoice logs, settlement records
- Ensure consistent reporting periods for comparison

2. Invoice Matching
- Compare each invoice on vendor statement against AP records
- Verify invoice numbers, dates, and amounts match exactly
- Confirm partial payment status and open invoice balances
- Identify missing invoices in either system

3. Payment Verification
- Match payments shown on vendor statement against payment records
- Verify payment dates, amounts, and reference numbers
- Confirm payments are applied to correct invoices

4. Identifying Discrepancies (common issues to investigate):
- Timing differences: Payments in transit or invoices received after statement date
- Amount discrepancies: Different invoice amounts or partial payments
- Missing transactions: Items recorded by one party but not the other
- Duplicate entries: Same transaction recorded multiple times
- Misapplied payments: Payments credited to wrong invoices or accounts

5. Resolution Process
- Document all discrepancies in reconciliation worksheet
- Contact vendor to clarify differences
- Obtain supporting documentation (proof of payment, invoice copies)
- Make necessary adjusting entries in the system
- Request corrections from vendor if needed

6. Final Reconciliation
- Ensure both parties' records show same outstanding balance
- Document reconciliation process and retain supporting materials
- Update records with agreed-upon adjustments
