## Migration Plan: Streamlit to React + Fluent UI

This document outlines the plan to migrate the invoice/payment reconciliation tool from Streamlit (Python) to a modern React frontend using Fluent UI, while also improving the current Streamlit scenario for immediate usability.

---

## 1. Streamlit UI Improvements (Immediate)
- Remove the Mapping Summary table.
- Refine the mapping step to use a clean, accessible layout (inspired by Fluent UI):
  - Use clear section headers, spacing, and labels.
  - Group mapping fields in a visually distinct card/box.
  - Add tooltips/help text for each mapping dropdown.
  - Highlight required fields (e.g., invoice number) with color or an asterisk.
- Add a visual progress indicator for the steps (optional).
- Reference best practices and UI ideas from:

## 2. React + Fluent UI Migration (New Project)
- Create a new React app (e.g., with Vite or Create React App).
- Use Fluent UI (Microsoft) for all components: https://react.fluentui.dev/
- Key UI features:
  - Stepper/progress bar for workflow (Upload → Map → Review → Results)
  - Drag-and-drop file upload with validation
  - Mapping step: Table/grid with dropdowns for each standard field, auto-suggested columns, required field highlighting
  - Results: Expandable/collapsible rows, status badges, side-by-side invoice/payment details
  - Modern, accessible, dark mode compatible
- Backend: Python (FastAPI or Flask) for data cleaning, matching, and reconciliation logic (reuse/refactor existing code)
- API endpoints:
  - /upload (POST): Accepts files, returns cleaned data and suggested mappings
  - /reconcile (POST): Accepts mapping, returns reconciliation results
- Use design inspiration from the above links and Fluent UI best practices.

## 3. Example UI Features (from references)
- Dashboard with summary stats (total invoices, matched, unmatched, partial, etc.)
- Visual status indicators (badges, color coding)
- Search/filter for results
- Export to Excel/CSV
- Help/tooltips for each step
- Responsive layout for desktop/tablet/mobile

## Next Steps
- [ ] Update Streamlit app as described
- [ ] Scaffold new React + Fluent UI project
- [ ] Refactor backend logic for API use
- [ ] Implement frontend components step by step
